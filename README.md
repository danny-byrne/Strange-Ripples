This is the original Project that will become Docx-to-React transpiler, a tool for writers to have a single source of truth for their content.

When making changes to a piece of writing, each change has to be propogated across multiple outlets, making it unmanageable.

The idea is that writers have multiple outputs for their content; substack, medium, personal blogs, published material.

Markup is specified using <bracket> syntax withing the .docx itself, Docx-To-React sees the markup and creates React components.
